Although whole grain oats is the first ingredient listed, more than 50% of the carbohydrates are in the form of sugar.


In each serving, 48 Calories are from sugar.


Due to its ""whole grain"" claim on the label, Lucky charms would be universally recommended to someone with type II diabetes (blood sugar is high at times and difficult to regulate).


According to nutrient content claim guidelines, Lucky Charms cereal is a low-fat cereal."	23	"2024-09-04 13:00:47;

"Ling is an international student who lives in Florida Avenue Residence (FAR) dorm. And, yes, it is far away from much of the campus! Luckily, Ling has a very social resident assistant (RA) who was planning an ice cream social on Thursday at 8 pm. So, that would be Ling's social time with friends after studying. Ling had a great time socializing and won the contest for the tallest ice cream cone eaten in full before 9 pm.  But, later that evening, Ling struggled with bloating, gas, and runny stool. She remembers that her mother had lactose intolerance. But Ling needs to figure out what that even means! Help her out by answering the questions below:

A.  Define lactose and explain if it needs to be digested before absorption.



B. Define lactase and discuss if it has anything to do with the case study above.




C. What could Ling have done to prevent the uncomfortable signs and symptoms associated with lactose intolerance?




D. Lactose intolerance is correlated with different regions"	1	2024-09-22 19:29:55	ariston2@illinois.edu	"Used 1 times: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Gb5MRhGxk

"How does a diet high in soluble fiber contribute to a decrease in [blood
cholesterol] and specifically LDL levels?


Fiber binds to cholesterol directly in the bloodstream 


Fiber binds to bile, preventing its recycling and promoting the use of cholesterol to make more bile


Fiber increases the production of insulin, which lowers cholesterol


 Fiber converts cholesterol into energy"	5	"2024-10-11 21:00:02;
