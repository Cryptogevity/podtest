"As you are cycling to classes one day, you pass a construction site on Green Street for a
new building and stop to watch for a few minutes. A crane is lifting a batch of bricks on
a pallet to an upper floor of the building. Suddenly, a brick falls off while the pallet is
rising. You clock the time it takes the brick to hit the ground at 2.4 seconds. The crane,
fortunately, has height markings, and you see the brick fall off the pallet at a height of 13
meters above the ground. A falling brick, as we all know, can be dangerous, and you
wonder how fast the brick was going when it hit the ground. Since you are taking

"You are on the west bank of a river which flows due south and want to swim

normal force is supposed to be perpendicular to the surface of contact. In a classic carnival ride, patrons stand against the wall in a cylindrically shaped room. Once the room gets spinning fast enough, the floor drops from the bottom of the room! Friction between the walls of the room and the people on the ride make them the “stick” to the wall so they do not slide down. Since the person is in circular motion. They are accelerated toward the center. My question is then how does the wall exert a normal force on the person. The way I see it there is some centripetal force (I'm not entirely sure how this arises tho please explain) accelerating the person towards the center. Then a normal force must oppose this are be pointed toward the wall. This is impossible tho so the normal force must then be centripetal acceleration but this also doesn't make sense because the circular motion caused the normal force. In which case I don't understand what causes this. I'm very confused.|5|Conceptual Questions|Normal Force, Centripetal Force, Circular Motion, Friction, Forces in Non-Inertial Reference Frames

The question doesn't say anything about the verticality of the wall. I thought it was safe to assume the wall was strictly vertical. Under this assumption your first point doesn't make sense. Gravity is downwards. The normal force is horizontal and therefore cannot be caused by gravity. Under this assumption your second point also doesn't make sense since the normal force wouldn't counteract gravity. The way I see it, if the wall is completely vertical no matter how fast the it is spinning a person will always fall since gravity is downwards and the normal force has no vertical component. Also under this assumption no normal force can even exist since a person cannot lean against a wall? Therefore is it impossible for the walls to be 100% vertical?

"A neighbor's child wants to go to a carnival to experience the wild rides. The
neighbor is worried about safety because one of the rides looks particularly
dangerous. She knows that you have taken physics and so asks you for advice.
The ride in question has a m = 4 kg chair which hangs freely from a L = 10 m
long chain attached to a pivot on the top of a tall tower. When the child enters
the ride, the chain is hanging straight down. The child is then attached to the
chair with a seat belt and shoulder harness. When the ride starts up, the chain
rotates about the tower. Soon the chain reaches its maximum speed and remains
rotating at that speed, which corresponds to one rotation about the tower every 3
seconds. When you ask the operator, he says the ride is perfectly safe. He
demonstrates this by sitting in the stationary chair. The chain creaks but holds,
and he is mass is MO = 90kg. Has the operator shown that the ride is safe for a
Mc = 25 kg child?"|1|Homework Questions|Safety of Amusement Rides  , Forces on the Ride  , Centripetal Acceleration, Tension in a Chain  , Mass and Weight, Comparison of Operator and Child Masses  , Maximum Speed and Rotation Period

I am confused about the application of the COM reference frame in 1d collisions- the formulas seem inconsistent. Let us use the bumper car example in the homework. We have two masses, the 114kg and the 93kg, going at 4.7m/s and -3.6m/s. By using the fact that Vim,cm = Vm,ground - vground,cm, we can say that block 1's velocity in the COM frame is 4.7m/s - 0.97m/s = 3.73m/s. For block 2, we do the same, where -3.6 - 0.97 gives us -4.57. Now we reverse the sign to get the final velocity in the COM frame, -3.73 and 4.57 respectively. When I apply this same formula to convert back, it messes up the signs... They should be added not subtracted. Why doesnt this conversion formula work both ways?|1|Homework Questions|Center of Mass, One-Dimensional Collisions, Velocity Transformation, Conservation of Momentum, Sign Convention in Physics

You just said it again; i want to find vfm2. Vfm2 = v2cmfinal + vcm you just said. But that gives us 4.57 PLUS 0.97 WHICH IS NOT CORRECT! It should be a final of 3.6!|1|Homework Questions|Final Velocity Calculation, Conservation of Momentum, Center of Mass, Elastic Collision

"describe what happens to the momentum of the IOLab as it...

1. Rolls toward the rubber band
2. Collides with the rubber band
3. Rolls away from the rubber band"|1|Homework Questions|Momentum, Collision Dynamics, Elastic vs. Inelastic Collision, Conservation of Momentum, Forces during Collision, Motion and Kinematics
What sensors and/or measurements would you need to make to verify your description of what happens to the IOLab's momentum?|1|Homework Questions|Momentum, Sensor Types for Momentum Analysis, Data Collection Methods, Experimental Setup for IOLab, Change in Momentum
"While the IOLab collides with the rubber band, it experiences a force that starts at zero, increases to a maximum, then decreases back to zero. The force from the rubber band on the IOLab will always point towards the device.

 

If we were to model the rubber band as a simple spring, what would you expect a plot of force vs time from the collision to look like? What measurement or measurements could you use to find out if this model is appropriate?"|1|Conceptual Questions|Force vs. Time Graph, Spring Model, Hooke's Law, Collision Dynamics, Measurement Techniques, Experimental Validation
"The friction in the wheels of your IOLab is quite small - you probably determined it to be around 
. Nevertheless, it has a significant effect on the collision that occurs.

How would this friction affect the collision overall? In what direction will the friction act during (1) the time when the rubber band is stretching, (2) the time when the rubber band is fully stretched, and (3) the time when the rubber band is contracting?"|1|Conceptual Questions|Friction in Collisions  , Effects of Friction on Motion  , Rubber Band Mechanics  , Direction of Forces during Stretching and Contracting  , Kinematics of the System
