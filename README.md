Opening the refrigerator door, he is trying to fuel his body post-workout to get the most “gains” as he prepares for a men’s physique bodybuilding competition in two months. He quickly shuts the refrigerator door and glances at the kitchen table where his Men’s Health magazine rests in a heap of his mail.  One of the articles highlighted on the front of the magazine suggests that individuals should cut out all dietary carbohydrates to “lean out” and lose fat before a competition. For a moment, he flips to the Men’s Health article and reads through the information as it states:
