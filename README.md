Although whole grain oats is the first ingredient listed, more than 50% of the carbohydrates are in the form of sugar.


In each serving, 48 Calories are from sugar.


Due to its ""whole grain"" claim on the label, Lucky charms would be universally recommended to someone with type II diabetes (blood sugar is high at times and difficult to regulate).


According to nutrient content claim guidelines, Lucky Charms cereal is a low-fat cereal."	23	"2024-09-04 13:00:47;
