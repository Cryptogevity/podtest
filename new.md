## Top Questions over all
1. when is the combined final exam. number of asked times: 6
2. If m1 > m2 and the two blocks collide completely elastically, which of the following statements are true about mass m2 only? Both momentum and mechanical energy are conserved for m2. Only momentum is conserved for m2. Only mechanical energy is conserved for m2. Neither momentum nor mechanical energy are conserved for m2. More information is needed to determine if momentum and mechanical energy are conserved for m2. number of asked times: 6
3. when is the make up exam for exam 2 number of asked times: 6
4. After walking to the right edge of the boat, how far has the man moved from his original location? (What is his new location?) number of asked times: 5
5. Now the racquet ball is moving straight toward the wall at a velocity of vi = 17.1 m/s. The ball makes an inelastic collision with the solid wall and leaves the wall in the opposite direction at vf = -11.6 m/s. The ball is in contact with the wall for the same amount of time as in the elastic collision above. What is the magnitude of the average force the wall exerts on the ball? number of asked times:4

## Top Conceptual question 
1. The friction in the wheels of your IOLab is quite small - you probably determined it to be around . Nevertheless, it has a significant effect on the collision that occurs. How would this friction affect the collision overall? In what direction will the friction act during (1) the time when the rubber band is stretching, (2) the time when the rubber band is fully stretched, and (3) the time when the rubber band is contracting? number of asked times: 2
2. what is the spring constant? number of asked times: 2
3. why do we add vcm in the conversion back? number of asked times: 1
4. If the ball slows down after the collision (energy was lost), how will the two angles shown compare? number of asked times: 1
5. If the ball instead rebounds off the wall elastically, how does the magnitude of the net impulse imparted to the ball compare to when the collision was inelastic? number of asked times: 1
